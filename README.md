# Location
Simple Fetch location using location manager, FusedLocationProviderApi. Convert into address using Geocoder. Places API Google to get the name of the place using location coordinates.
This project was started for the research project which finally became A-SUM.
The idea here is to get the location using location manager which later was updated to FusedLocationProviderApi (Both code exist in the repository). Aftere getting the location the address is shown. These location coordinates are also used to get the place using Google Places API.
